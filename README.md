1. Find pairs with a given sum. - Using simple sorting 
2. Find pairs with a given sum. - Using hashmaps
3. Given two unsorted arrays, find the pair with a given sum.
    ```
    Input :  arr1[] = {-1, -2, 4, -6, 5, 7}
                arr2[] = {6, 3, 4, 0}  
                x = 8
    ```
    You can have multiple pairs. - Brute Force.

    You can have multiple pairs. - Using Hash Maps.
5. Find if a contigious subarray with sum 0 is present in the given array(Unsorted with postive and negative elements).

    ```
    Input: array[]= {3,1,8,-9,7}
    Output : [1,8,-9] - return this subarray
    ```
    Brute Force
6. Find if a contigious subarray with sum 0 is present in the given array(Unsorted with postive and negative elements).

    ```
    Input: array[]= {3,1,8,-9,7}
    Output : true
    ```
    Using HashMaps
7. Find if a contigious subarray with sum 0 is present in the given array(Unsorted with postive and negative elements). - Assume you have multiple subarrays and print the subArray

    ```
    Input: array[]= {3,1,8,-9,7,5,7,-3,-4}
    Output : [[1,8,-9],[7,-3,-4]] - return this subarray
    ```
